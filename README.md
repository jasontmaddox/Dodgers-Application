The Report 5.6 files are an example of a Bayesian analysis report completed for school. I have included the R file for the code and a pdf file as the writeup.

The Homework 6 files are an example of a homework assignment from an advanced computational course I completed. There are two pdf files. One that is the assignment directions and the other is the output from the markdown file that is also included.
